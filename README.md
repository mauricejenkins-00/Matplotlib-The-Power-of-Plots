Matplotlib The Power of Plots

Background: 
What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?
So, let's take what you've learned about Python Matplotlib and apply it to a real-world situation and dataset:

While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you. Staying true to your mission, you've joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

Overview:
For this assignment we use the provided datasets, Mouse_metadata.csv and study_results.csv, to observe changes or phenomena in lab tests conducted on mice to test the effects of pharmaceutical products. Using Matplotlib we are able to create visualizations and generate a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen, to support our conclusions. Using the summary table we were able to produce a number of visualizations using the Matplotlib library to support our conclusions.


Conclusion: 
From the data we can make 3 observations... 

#1 being that there is a slightly larger population of male mice presented compared to the female population. 
#2 The larger the mouse tested the heavier the volume of tumor present in its body. 
#3 Drug Capomulin has the greatest amount of timepoints and Ramicane comes in second with the second most timepoints.

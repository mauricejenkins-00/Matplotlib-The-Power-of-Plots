Matplotlib The Power of Plots

Overview:
For this assignment we use the provided datasets, Mouse_metadata.csv and study_results.csv, to observe changes or phenomena in lab tests conducted on mice to test the effects of pharmaceutical products. Using Matplotlib we are able to create visualizations and generate a summary statistics table of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each regimen, to support our conclusions. Using the summary table we were able to produce a number of visualizations using the Matplotlib library to support our conclusions.


Conclusion: 
From the data we can make 3 observations... 

#1 being that there is a slightly larger population of male mice presented compared to the female population. 
#2 The larger the mouse tested the heavier the volume of tumor present in its body. 
#3 Drug Capomulin has the greatest amount of timepoints and Ramicane comes in second with the second most timepoints.
